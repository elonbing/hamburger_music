**Note:** This script was originally written by Elon Bing in the summer of 2014. I've moved it here temporarily.

**I'm working on writing out more documentation for this project, but main script "makepoetry.py" does the following:**
- goes to Youtube and selects a random video
- scrapes a line from it's closed captions
- saves that scaped line as a .txt document to a folder defined in the script
